# View Every Tile
This project provide services to compute and display the [slippy map tiles](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_map_tilenames),
the maximum cluster, and maximum square of all your outdoor activities on a map, just as
[VeloViewer](https://veloviewer.com/explorer), [StatsHunters](https://www.statshunters.com),
[Squadrats](https://squadrats.com/activities), and [RideEveryTile](https://rideeverytile.com) do.

Unlike the mentioned providers, this project
* works with local GPX files (that can be downloaded for example with [strava-activity-downloader](https://github.com/mouton0815/strava-activity-downloader))
* displays the growth of your maximum cluster over the course of time in a nicely animated form.
